        <p class="section-intro">
          My style of coaching brings together a range of tools to support you to learn and grow
          through life’s challenges, and supervision, training and consultation are available to
          support both individual practice and organisational needs.

            <h3>Supervision</h3>
            <p>
              Supervision is a form of supported reflective practice that allows you to consider
              and process issues in your work life; both the successes and the challenges.
              My style of supervision utilises strengths-based, narrative and reflective approaches.
              I use a blend of motivational interviewing techniques, Socratic questioning and
              reflective learning cycles to support your process of insight and knowledge gaining.
              I am a registered social worker, who also supervises people from other professional
              backgrounds. Supervision can be for anyone who feels like they would benefit from it
              and is a great professional growth tool. It can also help to safeguard mental
              wellbeing for those who engage in emotionally taxing work.

            <h3>Coaching</h3>
            <p>
              My style of coaching brings together a range of tools to support you to learn and
              grow through life’s challenges. The tools and frameworks include CBT (Cognitive

              (including Te Whare Tapa Wha), Socratic questioning, strengths-based and

              and organisational issues, including team mediation and facilitation, workshop
              facilitation, strategic planning facilitation, external review of education and
